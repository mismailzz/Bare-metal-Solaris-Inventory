# Bare-metal-Solaris-Inventory
The script can be used to build inventory for the bare-metal server having the Solaris Operating System. The script could be helpful to get the updated inventory of your Solaris-based environment. You can automate it for multiple servers by running it through Puppet-Bolt. The login user must have the sudo privileges. You can also modify and extract commands from the script to get the general information of your Solaris environment.
